We are a team of 4 UW Informatics students passionate about improving the usefulness of education information. We are currently working on a capstone project that collects, processes, and presents informative course information so that students can have a better idea before signing up for a class. We use this repo to host the project code and technical documentation. Currently, we are still in the early stage of the project. Stay tuned for upcoming development!
